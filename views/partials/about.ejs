<p id="about-me-text">Hi, I'm Caleb Hering, sometimes also known as <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">'c-hering'</span> or <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">'Toastyyyyy'</span>.
  I'm a 15yr old developer from Bethesda, Maryland and a sophmore at Walt Whitman Highschool. In the future I hope to study and persue
<span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Computer Science</span>, <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Cyber Security/Cryptography</span>, <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Robotics</span>
and <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Busines Managment</span>. More specifically than computer science is <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Machine Learning</span> and <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Web Development</span>.
<br/><br/>My love for programming/engineering first developed when I watched <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">WarGames</span> for the first time out of many times to come.
This love grew through stories of my late grandfather, who worked at <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Bell Labs</span>, and through any books I could find on
programming. Recently I took a month long class in Cambridge England, with a student at Pembrook College of Cambridge University who was working on <span style="color: #4CD4B0;">Quantum Computers</span>.
This opened my eyes and started a fire in the world of electrical engineering and Quantum Computing.
<br/><br/>Currently I am working on personal projects to progress my knowledge in computer science concepts, and programming languages. I also am working on
robots with my school FRC team; Team 1389. Then on the side I am working to become a freelance developer, creating websites, or other programs. Check me out on
